.bmp works for Minesweeper X. However For other minesweeper clients you might have to change the format to something like .png, .jpg or anything else
That is just a heads up.

INSTALLTION:

- First open your minesweeper client then Click Edit or Extras and find a custom skins tab
- After select the goof.bmp or goof2.bmp
- That's it!

Notes:
Just if you are wondering if i'll make more skins .
I might because right now i dont feel like making anymore but
I most likely will if you ask me to!
